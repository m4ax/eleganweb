Transfer protocols like FTP have been the backbone of data movement over the internet for decades. But as technology advances, organizations find themselves at a crossroad: continue with the traditional, manual, and often cumbersome FTP routes, or migrate to modern cloud solutions that promise scalability, flexibility, and efficiency.

At Elegan, we understand the intricacies involved in complex data transfers. That's why we've harnessed the power of AI to streamline your migration from FTP servers to cloud-based systems. With features like AI integration, automatic column mapping, built-in transformation functions, one-click error fixes, custom validations, and automatic data cleaning, we ensure your move is not just a migration, but a transformation that sets you up for future success.

## Understanding the Need for Migration

### The Limits of Traditional FTP

FTP has been a reliable method for transferring files, but it has limitations:

- **Security Concerns:** FTP does not inherently encrypt data, making it vulnerable to interception.
- **Scalability Issues:** Handling an increasing volume of data with FTP can be challenging and costly.
- **Operational Complexity:** As businesses grow, the manual efforts required to manage FTP transfers can become unmanageable.

### Why Migrate to the Cloud?

Moving to the cloud presents a plethora of benefits, including:

- **Enhanced Security:** Cloud providers offer robust security features to protect your data.
- **Cost-effective Scalability:** Adjust storage and services based on your current needs, without a significant upfront investment.
- **Automated Processes:** Reduce manual tasks with automation, allowing your team to focus on strategic initiatives.
