# Unlocking Efficiency: Automated Ingestion of Data from Email Workflows

In today's digital ecosystem, efficiency isn't just a goal—it's a necessity for survival and success. Companies are inundated with a vast array of data, much of which arrives via email. From customer inquiries and purchase orders to invoices and delivery notifications—emails are a treasure trove of critical business information.

Manual processing of such data isn't only archaic but also fraught with errors and inefficiencies. This is where automated ingestion of data from email workflows comes in as a game-changer. Elegan specializes in making these transitions seamless, leveraging AI to elevate your data migration process.

## The Flaws in Manual Processing

Before diving into the depths of automation, let's unpack why the manual handling of email data is falling out of favor.

- **Time-Consuming:** Manually extracting and inputting data from emails into databases or CRM systems takes up precious time.
- **Error-Prone:** Manual data entry is susceptible to human error, leading to inaccuracies in critical business operations.
- **Inconsistent Data Handling:** Different employees might have varying methods of processing, leading to inconsistent data outcomes.
- **Scalability Challenges:** As businesses grow, the volume of emails increases, making manual processing less feasible.

6. **Confirmation and Feedback:** You receive a confirmation of the successful data import, and the AI system learns from any corrections to improve over time.

### Benefits of Automated Data Ingestion

Implementing an automated data ingestion system streamlines operations and brings about numerous advantages, such as:

- **Increased Productivity:** Employees can focus on high-value tasks, leaving the mundane data entry to automation.
