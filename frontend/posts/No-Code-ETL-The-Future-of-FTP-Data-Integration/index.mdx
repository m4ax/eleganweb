# No-Code ETL: The Future of FTP Data Integration

In the rapidly advancing world of data integration, companies are continuously seeking more efficient, less time-consuming methods to handle the increasing volumes of data they need to process. ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) has been the backbone of data integration strategies for decades. But now, there’s a transformation underway. With the rise of no-code platforms, FTP data integration is entering a new era—one where efficiency, speed, and ease-of-use reign supreme. Enter Elegan, a pioneering force in no-code ETL, providing solutions perfectly tailored for this futuristic landscape.
